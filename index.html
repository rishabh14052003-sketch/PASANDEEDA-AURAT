            <h2>To My Princess</h2>
            <p>I couldn't let World Princess Day pass without telling you how truly special you are to me.</p>
            <p>Every time I see you, my heart races. Your presence makes everything brighter, and I find myself thinking
                about you more than I ever imagined possible.</p>
            <p>You deserve to be celebrated not just today, but every single day. You deserve someone who sees how
                amazing you are, who appreciates your kindness, your spirit, and everything that makes you uniquely YOU.
            </p>
            <p style="color:#dc2626;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">I have feelings for you, and I wanted you to
                know that you mean the world to me. 💕</p>
            <p>Thank you for being the incredible person you are. You truly are a princess in every sense of the word.
            </p>
